- Complete email sync (initial + incremental + real-time)
- Smart contact extraction with 90%+ accuracy
- Calendar and contacts sync
- Background job system with monitoring
- Core database layer with optimized queries
- Basic UI showing synced data

**Success Metrics**:
- Sync 10,000 emails in < 5 minutes
- Extract contacts with > 90% accuracy
- Handle real-time updates with < 5s latency
- Zero data loss during sync operations

### Phase 2: AI Intelligence & Automation (Weeks 4-6)

- Email statistics and analytics dashboard

**Success Metrics**:
- AI query accuracy > 85%
- Email draft quality rated 4+/5 by users
- Enrichment data found for > 60% of contacts
- < 2s response time for AI queries

### Phase 3: Proactive AI Agent System (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Create an always-on, proactive AI assistant

**Deliverables**:
- Skill-based AI agent framework
- Persistent agent memory and context
- Custom skill creation interface
- Proactive notifications and suggestions
- Multi-agent coordination system
- Advanced workflow automation
- Agent personality and behavior customization

**Success Metrics**:
- Agents successfully complete > 80% of assigned tasks
- User engagement with proactive suggestions > 50%
- Agent response coherence across sessions > 90%
- Workflow automation saves > 2 hours/week per user

## Core Design Principles

1. **Composability First**: Every component is standalone and testable
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase delivers immediate value
3. **AI-Native Architecture**: Data structures optimized for LLM consumption
4. **Event-Driven Design**: Full audit trail for AI training
5. **Privacy by Design**: User data never leaves their control
6. **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs and excellent documentation

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, tRPC, PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI/Anthropic, pgvector
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (OAuth 2.0)
- **Background Jobs**: pg-boss with PostgreSQL
- **Existing Code**: 70% from Analog (calendar) and Nimbus (drive)

## Team Organization

### Core Team (Weeks 1-3)
- 2 Senior Full-Stack Engineers
- Focus: Foundation and shared infrastructure

### Parallel Teams (Weeks 4-8)
- **Team A**: AI Integration (2 engineers)
- **Team B**: Frontend & UX (2 engineers)  
- **Team C**: Data Pipeline & Enrichment (1 engineer)
- **Team D**: Testing & DevOps (1 engineer)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Gmail API Limits**: Implement intelligent caching and batch operations
2. **AI Response Quality**: Extensive prompt engineering and fallback strategies
3. **Data Privacy**: Local-first architecture with encrypted storage
4. **Performance at Scale**: PostgreSQL partitioning and query optimization
5. **LLM Costs**: Response caching and smart context management

## Budget Considerations

- **Development**: 6-8 engineers for 8 weeks
- **Infrastructure**: ~$500/month initially, scaling with users
- **AI Costs**: ~$0.50-$2.00 per user per month
- **Third-party APIs**: ~$0.10-$0.50 per enriched contact

## Go-to-Market Strategy

1. **Week 8**: Internal alpha with 10 users
2. **Week 10**: Private beta with 100 users
3. **Week 12**: Public beta with freemium model
4. **Month 6**: Enterprise features and team collaboration

## Definition of Success

- **Technical**: System handles 1M+ emails without degradation
- **User**: 50+ daily active users with > 80% retention
- **Business**: Clear path to $10k MRR within 6 months
- **AI**: Users report 10+ hours saved per month
