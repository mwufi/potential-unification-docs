## Critical Path Analysis

The critical path (longest dependency chain) is:
```
Project Setup (1d) →
Database Schema (2d) →
Auth System (2d) →
Core API (3d) →
Job Queue (2d) →
Gmail OAuth (2d) →
Email Sync (4d) →
Contact Extraction (2d) →
Basic UI (3d) →
[Parallel work begins]
```
**Total**: 21 days (3 weeks) before parallel work can begin

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Gmail API limits | High | Implement caching, batch operations |
| Database performance | High | Indexes, partitioning, read replicas |
| AI response quality | Medium | Extensive prompt testing, fallbacks |
| Integration failures | Medium | Contract testing, mocks |

### Process Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency delays | High | Buffer time, parallel tracks |
| Scope creep | Medium | Strict phase boundaries |
| Team coordination | Medium | Daily standups, clear ownership |
| Quality issues | Low | Automated testing, code reviews |
