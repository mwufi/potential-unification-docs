# AI CRM MVP - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

We're building an AI-powered CRM that automatically extracts contacts from Gmail, enriches them with social data, and provides intelligent insights through natural language queries. This MVP leverages existing code from the Analog (Calendar) and Nimbus (Drive) projects to accelerate development.

## Core Features

### 1. Gmail Integration & Contact Extraction
- OAuth authentication with Gmail
- Automatic email sync (initial + real-time)
- Smart contact extraction from emails
- Signature parsing for phone/title/company

### 2. Intelligent Contact Management
- Auto-organized contact database
- Relationship strength scoring
- Interaction timeline
- Email communication history

### 3. AI-Powered Intelligence
- Natural language queries: "Who are my top clients?"
- Relationship insights and suggestions
- Email draft generation
- Follow-up reminders

### 4. Background Enrichment
- Twitter/X post monitoring
- Social profile discovery
- Activity-based insights
- Automated data updates

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture
- Track all user actions as events
- Enable future AI training
- Support for automation workflows
- Real-time updates

## Technical Architecture

### Reusable Components (70% from existing)
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Google OAuth
- **UI Framework**: Next.js 15 + shadcn/ui
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **API Layer**: tRPC for type safety
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready setup

### New Components (30% new development)
- **Gmail Sync Engine**: Parallel processing with smart extraction
- **AI Query System**: LLM integration with function calling
- **Background Jobs**: PostgreSQL-based queue system
- **Event Store**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Vector Search**: pgvector for semantic queries

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Project setup with existing components
- Database schema implementation
- Basic authentication flow

### Phase 2: Email Sync (Weeks 2-3)
- Gmail OAuth integration
- Contact extraction pipeline
- Background job processing

### Phase 3: Contact Management (Week 4)
- Rich contact profiles
- Interaction tracking
- Advanced extraction features

### Phase 4: AI Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Natural language interface
- Contact insights
- Email assistance

### Phase 5: Polish & Launch (Weeks 7-8)
- Enrichment features
- Performance optimization
- Beta user onboarding

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Start Simple, Scale Later
- PostgreSQL for everything (jobs, events, search)
- Monolithic Next.js app initially
- Direct LLM calls (no complex RAG yet)

### 2. User-Centric MVP
- Focus on single-user experience
- Core CRM features only
- Polish over features

### 3. AI-First Architecture
- Structure data for LLM consumption
- Event sourcing for future training
- Extensible function system

## Resource Requirements

### Team
- 2-4 skilled full-stack developers
- Experience with Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL
- Familiarity with LLM integration

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector
- Redis for caching (optional for MVP)
- LLM API access (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Gmail API access

### Timeline
- **MVP**: 6-8 weeks
- **Beta Launch**: Week 8
- **Production Ready**: Week 12

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- Email sync: 1000 emails in < 30 seconds
- Contact extraction: > 90% accuracy
- AI queries: > 80% useful responses
- System reliability: > 99% uptime

### User
- Onboard in < 5 minutes
- Find any contact in < 3 seconds
- Get AI insights in < 2 seconds
- Zero manual data entry

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
1. **Gmail API rate limits** → Intelligent batching & caching
2. **AI response quality** → Extensive prompt engineering
3. **Email parsing complexity** → Multiple extraction strategies

### Business Risks
1. **Slow OAuth approval** → Start process immediately
2. **Privacy concerns** → Clear data handling policies
3. **Competition** → Focus on AI differentiation

## Future Vision

### Post-MVP Roadmap
- **Month 2**: Calendar integration, team features
- **Month 3**: Mobile app, advanced AI agents
- **Month 4+**: Multi-provider support, API platform

### Platform Potential
- Extend beyond CRM to full productivity suite
- White-label for enterprise customers
- Marketplace for AI agents
- Integration ecosystem

## Why This Will Succeed

1. **Leverages Existing Code**: 70% foundation already built
2. **Solves Real Problem**: Everyone struggles with contact management
3. **AI Differentiation**: Natural language makes CRM actually usable
4. **Simple to Start**: Connect Gmail, get value immediately
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Event-driven design supports growth

## Next Steps

1. Finalize team allocation
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Week 1 sprint
4. Start Gmail OAuth approval process
5. Recruit 10 beta users

The architecture is designed, the roadmap is clear, and we can leverage significant existing code. This AI CRM can go from concept to MVP in 6-8 weeks with proper execution.
