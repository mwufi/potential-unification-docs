- Zod for validation
- Component structure from shadcn/ui
- Error handling patterns
```

### 3. Testing Strategy

- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: For critical paths
- **Manual Testing**: For AI responses

### 4. Deployment Strategy
```yaml
# Staging deployment (daily)
- Vercel preview deployments
- Feature flags for new features

# Production deployment (weekly)
- Thursday deployments only
- Rollback plan ready
- Monitor error rates
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Gmail API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement exponential backoff
   - Fallback: Queue for later processing

2. **AI Response Quality**
   - Mitigation: Extensive prompt testing
   - Fallback: Pre-built query templates

3. **Email Parsing Accuracy**
   - Mitigation: Multiple extraction strategies
   - Fallback: Manual contact editing

### Schedule Risks
1. **Delayed OAuth Approval**
   - Mitigation: Start process Week 1
   - Fallback: Development credentials

2. **Complex Edge Cases**
   - Mitigation: Focus on 80% use case
   - Fallback: Document limitations

## Success Metrics

## Team Allocation

### Recommended Team Structure
- **Tech Lead**: Architecture decisions, PR reviews

- **Frontend Dev**: UI/UX, React components
- **AI/ML Dev**: AI integration, prompts
- **DevOps**: Deployment, monitoring (part-time)

### Alternative: Small Team (2-3 devs)
- Week 1-2: All hands on foundation
- Week 3-4: Split backend/frontend
- Week 5-6: Pair on AI features
- Week 7-8: All hands on polish

## Post-MVP Roadmap

### Month 2: Enhanced Features

- Email compose/reply in app
- Advanced enrichment sources
- Team collaboration features

### Month 3: Scale & Polish
- Multi-provider support (Outlook)
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Advanced AI features (RAG)
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit)

### Month 4+: Platform Vision
- API for integrations
- Workflow automation
- Custom AI agents
- White-label options

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a realistic path to MVP in 6-8 weeks. The key is to:
1. Leverage existing code aggressively
2. Focus on core features only
3. Get user feedback early
4. Iterate based on real usage

The modular architecture ensures we can enhance and scale post-MVP without major refactoring.
